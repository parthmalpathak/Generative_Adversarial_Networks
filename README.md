# Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) on MNIST and Deep Convolutional GANs(DCGANs) on Human Faces Dataset.

## Overview
This implementation demonstrates the use of GANs to generate new data. It also gives an insight on the training time and way of image generation process through GANs.

## Demo Images
* **Images Generated through MNIST Dataset**
<img src="Sample Images/MNIST.png" width="600"/>
 
* **Images generated through Human Faces Dataset**
<img src="Sample Images/Human_Faces.png" width="600"/>

**NOTE:** The generated images are for demonstrational purposes and hyperparameter tuning may lead to generation of better examples.
